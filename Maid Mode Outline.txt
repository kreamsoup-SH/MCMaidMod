maid

You can make "maid_ingot" from "maid_ore" by using 'maid_Machien'

"maid_ore"s are spawning under y:4


You can get "Piece of LOVE" from "Dragon_Hime"(name: Kiyo)

"Dragon_Hime" follows "Anchin_chocolate"
If you already found "Kiyo's castle" and you have at least two "mc:Potion of Fire Resistance",
	you can get in 'dojoji_bell' and ring the bell and get her.
